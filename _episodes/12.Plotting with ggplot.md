## What is ggplot
- Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson
- Written by Hadley Wickham - a grad student at Iowa State
- Third graphic system in for R (along with Base and Lattice)
```r
> install.packages("ggplot2")
> library(ggplot2)
```

## Basic component of ggplot
- A data frame
- aes: aesthetic mappings showing how data are mapped to color, size
- geoms: geometric objects like points, lines, shapes.
- facets: for conditional plots.
- stats: statistical transformations like binning, quanti les, smoothing.
- scales: what scale an aesthetic map uses
- coordinate system

## Type of ggplot
* Basic qplot
```
- Same as plot in Base plot
- Nicer graphics than Base plot
- Difficult for customize
```
* Advanced ggplot
```
- Flexible with many built-in function
```

## Basic qplot: Scatter plot
- Plots are made of aes (size, shape, color) and geom (points, lines)
- Look for data in frame (or from parent directory)
```r
qplot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, data=iris)
```
- Add aesthetic (shape, color)
```r
qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data=iris,
      color=factor(Species),
      shape=factor(Species)) #aesthetic
```

- Add geom (points, lines)
```r
qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data=iris,
      geom=c("point","smooth")) #geometry
```

- Linear Fitting
```r
qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data=iris, color=Species,
      geom=c("point","smooth"),method="lm")
```
