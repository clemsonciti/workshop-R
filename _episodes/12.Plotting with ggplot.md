## What is ggplot
- Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson
- Written by Hadley Wickham - a grad student at Iowa State

## Basic component of ggplot
- A data frame
- aes: aesthetic mappings showing how data are mapped to color, size
- geoms: geometric objects like points, lines, shapes.
- facets: for conditional plots.
- stats: statistical transformations like binning, quanti les, smoothing.
- scales: what scale an aesthetic map uses
