## Input to R
- In R console, the symbol `>` stands for `R prompt`.
- The `#` is for comment insert.
- To clean the existing environment, remove all memory in previous sessions:

```r
> rm(list=ls())
```

## Using R as calculator
When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`
 * Other math functions: `sin, cos, log1(), log10(), exp`

```r
> a <- (1+2)*3-4^5
> b <- sin(1)+log10(20)*exp(2)
```

## Compare in R
* `==`: equality
* `!=`: inequality 
* `<`& `<=`: less than & less than or equal to
* `>`& `>=`: more than & more than or equal to

```r
> 1==1
```

## Assign Variables
- To assign variable in R, we can use both `<-` and `=` sign

```r
> a <- 1
> b = 2
```

Note that assignment does not print out value to R console. It save the variable in Environment section:

- To print the variable to console

```r
> a
> print(a)
```

The output will be like this:

```r
> a
[1] 1
> print(a)
[1] 1
```
But not to worry about the `[1]` in front. We will be learning about that in the later part

## Working directory
One important step in R is to define the working directory. It is particularly useful when you are working with files in the working directory and working in Linux environment in Palmetto:

```r
# print working directory
> getwd()
# set working directory
> setwd('C:/R/') # for Windows
> setwd('/user/home/R') # for Macs
```
## Seeking Help
In order to look for help files for function:
* Put `?` in front of function name, for example `rnorm` 

```r
> ?rnorm
> help(rnorm)
```
The help section will display:
